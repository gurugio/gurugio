Reading

The reading list is divided into seven parts. The papers in bold are suitable selections for assignment one. The first section lists papers that we are unlikely to discuss in detail in class. These readings provide essential background in research techniques and skills. The second section contains papers that might be appropriate for use in assignment 1. The remaining lists are numbered to cross-reference with the syllabus. The online syllabus has links to all the papers.
BACKGROUND

The following papers are considered background material. Most of them are quick, easy reads and will provide countless bits of wisdom on systems design, doing research, writing papers, and giving presentations. Some are papers you may have discussed in CS161; if you haven't read these, you definitely should as some discussions will assume the knowledge. For the rest, I urge you to read them sooner rather than later.
